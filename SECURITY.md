# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
* The latest *stable* release of the 5.x branch

See [UnrealIRCd releases](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/UnrealIRCd_releases) for information on older versions and End Of Life dates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report issues on the [bug tracker](https://bugs.unrealircd.org) and in the bug submit form **set the 'View Status' to 'private'**.

Do not report security issues on the forums or in a public IRC channel such as #unreal-support.
If you insist on e-mail then you can use syzop@unrealircd.org or security@unrealircd.org. Again, the bug tracker is preferred.

If you are *unsure* if something is a security issue, then report it at the bug tracker as a 'private' bug anyway. Better safe than sorry.
Do not ask around in public channels or forums.

You should get a response or at least an acknowledgement soon. If you don't hear back within 24 hours, then please try to contact us again.
