Numeric 005 allows the server to inform the client of any protocol specific features in the
IRCd.  The numeric is sent at connection time immediately after numeric 004. Additionally
the numeric is sent when a /version request is made by a local user, for remote users
numeric 105 is used but contains the same information.

Due to the limit imposed by RFC1459 on both the buffer size (512) and the amount of
parameters that can be sent in a single command (15) a total of 13 parameters may be
specified in each 005. Because of this, a client must be able to accept multiple 005s
consecutively. The format for the 005 message is as follows:

":" <servername> "005" SPACE <nickname> SPACE <token[=value]> SPACE ... ":are supported
by this server"

Currently UnrealIRCd supports several tokens that are included in numeric 005. A list of
all tokens, their respective value and a brief description are listed below.

Unrealircd attempts to follow the proposed ISupport standard as much as possible. Unrealircd
only ignores the standard in one regard, the TARGMAX token. This token is believed to be 
impractical and technically impossible to correctly implement due to existing limitations
in the standard. Therefore, this token is not currently supported. 

Unrealircd does additionally provide a few tokens which are not specified in the standard, these
include: HCN, AWAYLEN, WATCH, SILENCE, EXTBAN, ELIST, CMDS, NAMESX, UHNAMES, and WATCHOPTS.
Unrealircd also maintains a few legacy tokens such as MAXCHANNELS and WALLCHOPS to ensure
compatibility until the ISupport standard is more widely accepted by clients.

                                                           can be useful for the client to know

                                                           level of access. This token will
                                                           replace the WALLCHOPS token.

                                                           (+e) are supported by the server.

                                                           the server.

MAXLIST       mode:num,...    b:60,e:60,I:60               Specifies the maximum number of 
                                                           entries that may be added to a

                                                           This token replaces MAXBANS.

                                                           This token will replace MAXCHANNELS.

CHANNELLEN    number          32                           Provides the maximum length of a
                                                           channel name that a user can create.

                                                           the server will, from then on, send
                                                           all channel rights in a NAMES reply
                                                           instead of only the highest right
                                                           (eg: @+Person instead of @Person).

UHNAMES       none            none                         Indicates that (other) extended

                                                           server. If the client sends
                                                           "PROTOCTL UHNAMES" then the server
                                                           will, from then on, send user@host
                                                           information in a NAMES reply
                                                           (eg: @nick!ident@hostname).

WATCHOPTS     flags           A                            WATCH options supported. 'A' means
