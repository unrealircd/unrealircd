/* Configuration file for UnrealIRCd 6
 *
 * Simply copy this file to your conf/ directory, call it
 * 'unrealircd.conf' and walk through it line by line (edit it!)
 *
 * Important: All lines, except { and } end with an ;
 * This is very important, if you miss a ; somewhere then the
 * configuration file parser will complain and the file will not
 * be processed correctly!
 * If this is your first experience with an UnrealIRCd configuration
 * file then we really recommend you to read a little about the syntax,
 * this only takes a few minutes and will help you a lot:
