/*** Channel modes ***/

// The following module ('nocodes') is not a true channel mode.
// It simply enhances the existing channel mode +S/+c to include
// stripping/blocking of bold, underline and italic text.

/* See https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Extended_bans for information */

/*** Other ***/

// The hideserver module will hide /MAP and /LINKS to regular users.
// It does not truly enhance security as server names can still be

// The antirandom module will kill or *line users that have a nick,

// This helps to combat simple botnets/drones.
// Note that failure to set the right settings may ban innocent users.
// This is especially true if you are on a non-English network where
// the module may consider a sequence of characters "random" even though
// it is a perfectly pronounceable word in your language.

		 * action is taken (killed, *lined, see later on).
		 *  lower = more randomly looking users will be catched (but also more
		 *	  innocent users)
		 * higher = less chance of innocent users getting killed, but also less
		 *	  chance on bots getting catched.
		 * <2:  DON'T!!
		 *  4:  Works good, probably a few more innocent kills but if you got
		 *      quite a bot problem then this might be a useful setting.
