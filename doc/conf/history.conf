 * fetched via the HISTORY command (and possibly other commands in the future).

 * Persistent channel history
 *
 * You can also store channel history encrypted on disk.
 * This means channel history is preserved across IRCd restarts.
 * UnrealIRCd will only store channel history for channels that have both
 * channel mode +H and +P set.
 *
 * To enable this you need to create a Secret block like this:
 * This is only a simple example with passwords stored directly in the
 * configuration file.
 *
 * To get better security, read https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Secret_block
 * on alternative ways so you don't store passwords directly in the config.

/* 
 * UnrealIRCd has the following goals for storing channel history on disk:
 *
 * - All data within the .db's is encrypted
 * - We use a well-known encryption library, a good cipher and KDF,
 *   see Dev:UnrealDB for in-depth technical details.
 * - By default the log databases are stored in the data/history/ directory
 * - All .db files are cryptographically hashed so a third party can't tell
 *   which .db file belongs to which channel
 * - A 'master.db' file is present too, to achieve the above in a consistent
 *   and safe manner. Don't delete this file.
 * - Be sure to look at Secret block to see the various ways to store the key 
 *   (password) and pick one acceptable to your environment
