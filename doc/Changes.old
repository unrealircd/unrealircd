       <global servers>
       <irc operators>
       <unknown connections>

- Fixed a SJOIN3<->services problem
- Fixed a typo where it still said +I instead of +V in an error message
- Fixed the "Bad file descriptor" bug in SSL. This bugfix may be a bit risky
  as it is manipulating BIO fds. The reason openssl freaked at this, was
  that when a fd is closed, we change fds from 4 to 3 etc, in other words,
  we renumber fds. SSL didn't know this and if you would call SSL_set_fd it
  would close the connection/crash. Added SSL_change_fd() to change the FD
  directly through BIO_set_fd. 
- Fixed the masskill bug, hopefully. Was a delimiter/number array bug in
  find_server_b64_or_real, causing negative base64 to be accepted (bad).
  value 1-256 will never be able to be in two letters (a server name)

- Added SJOIN (SJ3 only) instead of JOIN/MODE in /join and discovered a bug in 
  SJOIN code, that if the line doesnt have a " " appeneded, it wont take the
  last users or first for that sake. Hopefully patched SJ3 code for it
- Added OPT target OPT_SJB64 and OPT_NOT_SJB64

  in connect moment thou) -stskeeps
