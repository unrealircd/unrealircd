Internet Relay Chat Operator Etiquette Guide (May, 1992)
[ $Id$ ]

Welcome! You've either been selected to be an IRC Operator or you have set
up your server and thus have taken on the dual task of IRC Server
Administrator and IRC Operator. Your future days will be filled with hours
of fun chatting on IRC, and then wondering why everyone you talked to went
away, because the links had apparently broken. 

Linking:
========

You will be assigned links from the IRC Routing Coordinators. Please
use these links and these links ONLY. The links have been designed to
maximize efficiency and make delays in chatting minimal. You will
usually be given two links, one to each regional backbone site.
Connect to the primary site first and then to the secondary site. You
should not need to connect to any other sites. You will be informed if
this policy changes.

Kills 
=====

/kill is a special operator command. You should use it with
care, and only if absolutely needed. The format is as follows:
/kill NICKNAME comment. Comment can be a phrase of almost any length
(within reason) and should be used for specifying the reason of the kill.
Example: /kill Trillian She's a Ghost
IRC Ghosts are created after a net split has occured and the net has yet to
relink. 

/wallops PHRASE This is used to talk to those users who have their
user mode set to +w. /wallops used to be a way for operators to talk
about important matters in linking etc., but it has little use
nowadays. 

/TRACE command /TRACE is useful to know what servers are connected to
what. Sometimes /trace can be confusing, especially if you are using
it for the first time.  Here is an example of a trace from
stekt1.oulu.fi to cdc835.cdc.polimi.it.

/TRACE cdc835.cdc.polimi.it

*** Link stekt1.oulu.fi<2.7.2> ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Link rieska.oulu.fi<2.7.1>e ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Link nic.funet.fi<2.7.1>e ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Link ircserver.et.tudelft.nl<2.7.1>e ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Link vesuv.unisg.ch<2.7.1>e ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Link apollo.di.unipi.it<2.7.1>e ==> cdc835.cdc.polimi.it
*** Oper Class[10] ==> Allanon[cdc835.cdc.polimi.it]  
*** User Class[11] ==> Lupandy[plus2.usr.dsi.unimi.it]  
*** Serv Class[3] ==> apollo.di.unipi.it[131.114.4.36] 132S 445C
*** User Class[11] ==> Punk[pluto.sm.dsi.unimi.it]  
*** User Class[11] ==> TheEdge[pluto.sm.dsi.unimi.it]  
*** User Class[10] ==> Mork[cdc835.cdc.polimi.it]  
*** User Class[11] ==> Lollo[c700-2.sm.dsi.unimi.it]  
*** User Class[11] ==> Attila[hp2.sm.dsi.unimi.it]  
*** Class 0  Entries linked 1
*** Class 11 Entries linked 5
*** Class 10 Entries linked 2
*** Class 3  Entries linked 1

From this output you can see that the route goes first to
rieska.oulu.fi (running version 2.7.1e), then nic.funet.fi,
ircserver.et.tudelft.nl, vesuv.unisg.ch, and apollo.di.unipi.it, after
which cdc835 is the next server. Then we see the connections on
cdc835: One operator (Allanon) and 6 users are on line. The class of
each connection is given. There is only one server connected to cdc835
at the moment, and that server is apollo.di.unipi.it (cdc835 is said
to be a "leaf" server at the moment). The numbers 132S 445C in the end
of line tell us, that there are 132 servers and 445 clients connected
to the servers from apollo onwards.  Finally we see a grand total of
connections in each connection class. 


/SQUIT server {comment}
   /squit isolates a specified server from the next closest server, when
you look at it along the trace path starting from your server. 
This is usually used in conjunction with CONNECT (explained later) to
reroute traffic. This will be described in detail in the section
"routing", preceding CONNECT.

   Usage (and examples): 

      /squit E

     If the network looks like this initially (and you are on server A)

 
          A <---> B <---> C <---> D
                          ^
                          |
                          v
                  G <---> E <---> F <---> ... (rest of the net)
                          

    Then after issuing the previous /squit the network would look like this:

          A <---> B <---> C <---> D
                          
                          
                  G <---> E <---> F <---> ...


    /squit E {comment}

	It usually helps to give a reason why you are sending a
	SQUIT for a server. This can be accomplished by sending
	the command "/squit server This link is making the US route
	through Finland". The SQUIT will then be sent out, and the 
	server sending the squit will WALLOP sending the comment
	so all operators can see it. 

/CONNECT server {portnum server2}
   /connect is used to establish a link between two servers. These
connections must be authorized by each server's ircd.conf file, but
any operator can issue a CONNECT between authorized servers. This
command is most often used in conjunction with SQUIT to reroute
traffic. 
   If only one argument is given, this command causes the server you
are on to attempt to connect to the server specified. For example,
"/connect B" (in the previous example) would cause your server (A) to
connect to B. 
   Suppose you wanted to reconnect server F to server E? You cannot
contact server F since it is no longer part of your network. However,
you can tell server E to connect to it. A remote CONNECT can be issued
to server E. 

   Examples (assume you are on server A):

   /connect B

   If the network initially looks like this:

         A      B <---> ... (rest of network)

   Then afterwards (if the connection succeeds) the network will look
   like this:

        A <---> B <---> ... 


   In the example where you wanted to reconnect server E to F, the
   following syntax would be appropriate (note: we are assuming that
   F's irc socket port is 6667, which is the default)

   /connect F 6667 E

   If the network initially looks like this:

         A <---> B <---> C <---> D
                         ^
                         |
                         v
                 G <---> E      F <---> ... 

   Then after your CONNECT request the network topology will look like this:

         A <---> B <---> C <---> D
                         ^
                         |
                         v
                 G <---> E <---> F <---> ... 

    Be careful when connecting servers that you know which command to
    use! If you simply issued "/connect F" from your server, the
    network would look like this:


    ... <---> F <--->  A <---> B <---> C <---> D
                                       ^
                                       |
                                       v
                               G <---> E 

    which for various reasons (discussed below) might be very
    undesirable. 

Routing
=======

   When and how should you do rerouting? This depends on where your
server is topologically located and whether you route traffic. If you
are a leaf node (i.e. only connect to one server at a time) then
chances are you won't need to do any routing at all.  Your ircd.conf
file should be written to connect to the best possible servers first
before trying alternates. At the most, you may decide to squit an
alternate server and connect to your primary if/when it goes back up.
This only involves local squits, however.

   If you are operating a backbone site, you may find yourself
rerouting things quite often. If the servers badger.ugcs.caltech.edu
(Pasadena, CA), irc.mit.edu (Boston, MA), minnie.cc.utexas.edu
(Austin, TX) and ucsu.colorado.edu (Boulder, CO) were routing traffic
in the following way:

    ... <---> minnie <---> badger <---> bucsd <---> ucsu <---> ...

It would make sense to either squit ucsu and reconnect it to minnie,
or disconnect minnie from badger and connect to ucsu, because
topologically (and geographically) ucsu and minnie are rather close.
There are occasions when US traffic for some reasons winds up being
routed through Australia. This is another case where traffic should
definitely be rerouted. However, there are sometimes occasions when
routing is going through "backdoor" methods. If you see something
totally outrageous (like the east coast and the west coast being
connected by eff.org) please ask for example on channel #twilight_zone
before you send any squits, because chances are, it's like that for a
reason.

   Of course, any operator can remotely squit or connect servers, so
if you see a problem and you're sure you know how to fix it, it's a
good idea to do so. If the operator of a server which is is being
routed poorly is online, it's probably best to contact him/her first,
though.

   Chances are that hub operators will be more familiar with the
general topology of the network and which servers connect to which
(which is why most of the manual routing is left to them), so if you
have any problems, talk to the other operators on operator channels
(#twilight_zone, #eu-opers etc.) That's what they are there for!
   Also, be aware that servers will notify all the operators online of
remote SQUITs and CONNECTs via WALLOPS.

Please let us know if there should be any additions to this guide. Again,
this is not MANDATORY, this is just a GUIDE. Please conduct yourself as 
an IRC Operator would...you are looked upon for assistance, both emotional
and mental.
