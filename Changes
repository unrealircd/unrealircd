  ircd_SSL_read must emulate the same. codemastr: could you check what the
  win32 equiviant of EIO is? I don't think my WSAEIO or whatever I called it
  in sys.h is correct.

  word would really really help.
- Changed version to beta12
- Add config option to the unreal service utility options are:
  unreal config startup auto|manual
    auto starts the service when the pc boots, manual requires you to run Unreal manually
  unreal config crashrestart delay (2k/XP only)

  ANTI_SPAM_QUIT_TIME - it simply replaces it with the message if enabled
- Make makecert.bat and encpem.bat show their use in titlebar when run

- Added set::ssl::options, with three options:
    fail-if-no-clientcert   - If SSL client connects and doesn't provide a client certificate, abort connection immediately
    verify-certificate      - Check the certificate's validity using X509 methods, check if we trust CA's, etc. 
                              It however does slip self signed certificates through UNLESS
    no-self-signed          - Don't allow self-signed certificates through (requires verify-certificate)

  stable. See aliases/aliases.conf for the format changes
- Numerous Sts-coded-conf3-while-sick bugs
- Added SVSLUSERS, allows changing of local/global max users. This is designed so services
  can make sure all servers report the same global max and that a local max can be adjusted
  if for example a clone flood occurs. It is NOT designed to make the max count higher than
  you actually have.
- Fixed a bug in the win32 debugger where the contents of the core file were not written
  until ok was clicked. Reported by Simon Bell.

  need to perform configuration tests. This is currently only implimented for dynamic linking
- Made the same system work under static linking. This (barring any bugs) should be the
  completion of conf3. :)
- Fixed a bug where chmode +q users could not kick chmode +a users. (#0000459) reported by
  jollino.

- Fixed exception in scanner on Windows
- Changed base version name to Unreal3.2, instead of Unreal3.2-Selene
- Made McSkaf part of core coder team
*** beta13 released ***
- Added set::htm to set HTM options via the config. set::htm is only valid if either
  commands.so or m_htm.so is loaded.
- Recoded some of +G to work MUCH faster. A compiled copy of the regex is now stored 
  in memory rather than compiling the regex each time the swear stripping was trigged. 
  This uses slightly more memory, but saves a signifigant amount of execution time.
  Idea inspired by a suggestion from CaliMonk

- Fixed a bug where leaving out the parameter to a password config entry would cause a
  crash, reported by AngryWolf (#0000623)

- Fixed set::dns error messages
- Fixed win32 compile error
- Fixed chmode +u again.
- Fixed a bug reported by mQ where it was possible to include spaces in a TKL host
- Documentation updates (added a section about features).
- Fixed remote /rehash bug (#0000600).
- Documentation updates (unreal32docs.html, example.conf).
- Added a new badword type, quit. This replaces the old CENSOR_QUIT. If you want to censor
  quit messages you create a badword quit {}. Additionally loading badwords.quit.conf will
  censor several badwords by default. Based on suggestions by Gargo
- Fixed two ident bugs (multihomed&connect), both resulted in ident not working.
- Added set::options::dont-resolve (=hostnames of incomming clients won't be resolved).
- Code cleanup (gcc 3.2 warnings with -Wall).
- Removed/updated some NS stuff
- Added EventMarkDel which marks an event for deletion for the (next) DoEvents() call.
- Fixed /rehash stall caused by delayed unloading of the scan module (deadlock).

- Fixed a bug where +x would make hosts lowercase (#0000810) reported by rayman
- Implemented a ban version {} (bans users based on CTCP VERSION). It works by sending out
  a CTCP VERSION when a user connects then checking the reply. If you don't use any 
  ban version{}'s then no version request is sent so users are not inconvenienced.
- Rewrote the "flood from unknown connection" system to kill all matching users immediately
  and also added set::anti-flood::unknown-flood-bantime and 
  set::anti-flood::unknown-flood-amount to set the length of time an unknown connection
  flooder is banned for and how much data (in KB) the user must send before being banned.
  This should fix (#0000767) reported by ora.
- Updated some documentation
- (Hopefully) fixed some Ziplinks problems
- Added missing except tkl {} documentation
- Documentation update and cleanup

- Fixed a typo in the docs for except throttle (#0000830) reported by CoNfOuNd
- Added set::modes-on-join to set channel modes that are set when a new channel is created.
- Fixed a typo in the HTM docs (#0000832) reported by CoNfOuNd
- Added anti-away-flood code, based on Bahamut. This prevents users from repeatedly using /away.
  This feature is disabled by default (see NO_FLOOD_AWAY in config.h). 
- Added set::anti-flood::away-count and set::anti-flood::away-period to control the away flood
  system.
- Moved the "missing user in SJOIN" notice to snomask +j
- Rewrote some of the set::allow-userhost-change code. Fixes (#000843) and (#0000791) reported

- Fixed 2 other oob reads in config parser (parsing of size and time).
- Fixed yet another oob read in config parser (ie: #0000841).
- Fixed a typo in the docs (#0000867) reported by tc
- Fixed a fast badword replace crash (#0000834) reported by orga

- Made gline/zline/kline take precedence over a shun in TKL (#0000870) reported by KnuX`
- Fixed a long standing typo where doc/example.conf still mentioned oflag e (#0000638)
  reported by twigboy.
- Possibly fixed an SSL crash bug (#0000871 and #000784) reported by shotgun and comrade
- Fixed opermode bug which could cause the ircd to crash a while later (#0000823).
- Changed throttling errormsg so mIRC recognizes it and waits a while.
- Added SSL quit error messages
- Fixed an SQLINE bug with sqlines without a reason
- Fixed a bug effecting additions/deletions of SQLINES and deletions of SVSNLINES (may be
  the cause of #0000866)
- Fixed MAJOR "messages are lost" bug which can cause various problems: ziplink corruption,
  duplicate user entry in sjoin, etc etc. This would happen if BUFFERPOOL was set too low (like
  the default) and you got a lot of traffic. It's now handled a bit better and you'll get
  a nice warning, additionally the default BUFFERPOOL is now set to MAXSENDQLENGTH*18 instead of
  *9. Thanks to ora and others which helped me tracing this down.
- Added tld::options::ssl so you can have different motd/rules files if the user is using SSL.
- Fixed cloaking bug reported by Rocko (#0000869).
- Added set::restrict-channelmodes, works exactly the same as restrict-usermodes, you can for
  example disallow using of channelmode u and L. Suggested by poisoner and others (#0000838).

- Improved IPv6 throttle hashing
- Make the above actually work
- Improved throttle hashing (both IPv4 and IPv6).
- Changed throttling so it now bans after M connects in N seconds rather than 2 connects in N 
  seconds. (set::throttle::connections).
- Updated channelmode +f "algorithm", much better now. Reported by JimmyZ, Rocko, and others.
- Added badword::action <replace|block>. (replace is default). If you specify block, instead
  of replacing the word with "<censored>" it will block the message from ever being sent. 
  (#0000557) suggested by paranomix
- Made /stats b output badword quit {} (#0000883) reported by AngryWolf
- Made except ban {} override ban ip {} (suggested by Lithium).
- Removed some old defines for the old password encryption system (#0000765) reported by
  AngryWolf
- Made it so you can use a ~ as the first character of an ident with /chgident (#0000765)
  reported by AngryWolf

- Updated some documentation
- Minor error msg improvements
- Fixed a bug with wrong hub/leaf settings ("non-hub introduced leaf") causing a crash 
  (#0000732).

  (#0000895) reported by Troco
- Added some information to the docs listing the file names for motd, rules, etc. (#0000519)
  suggested a LONG time ago by Jaw959

- Added some temporarely SQLINE debugging/trace code
- Fixed a PRIVMSG channelprefix bug reported by aragon (#0000902)
- Fixed far connect (+s +F): connects from U-lined servers are now hidden again.
- Added IP bans like *!*@194.109.* (#0000474).
- Fixed usermode +S: was accidently a local usermode (#0000909) reported by DukePyrolator.
- Enabled throttling support by default, you need to have a (correct) set::throttle block
  to make it work, otherwise it's just turned off.
- Some code cleanups (s_conf.c, now has a config_setdefaultsettings()).
- Fixed minor badwords /rehash memleak.
- Added link::options::nohostcheck which makes Unreal not to validate the incomming host/IP
  against the link::hostname field, useful for dynamic DNS hosts.
- Some documentation improvements regarding link::hostname.
- Changed the module umode adding function to allow an 'is_allowed' function. This fuction
  defines who may set the specified usermode.
- Made it so Ulined servers can use a TS that is in the past for topics (#0000448) reported 
  by thilo
- Fixed a bug with ban version {} where some clients didn't like the request we were sending.

- Preparing beta16: release notes ready, version updated in docs/text (except version.h).
- Changed version to beta16
- Various docs typo fixes, some reported by AngryWolf (#0000913)
- Mm, let's see what this checkin brings: 
  * Removed thread questions from Config, and autoconf code from
    configure.in, leaving in the old macros though, but inactive
    --enable-standardthreads is dead as of now
  * Undefined HOOKTYPE_SCAN_INFO
  * Removed CONF_EXCEPT_SCAN
  * Removed locking in events, Lock/UnlockEventSystem still active for other
    possible uses.
  * Removed scanners, web server module
  * Removed except scan {}
  * Removed SCAN_API stuff from l_commands.c, win32 makefiles, etc
  * Removed basically any mentions of threads in source tree, excepting
    threads.h which Resolver uses on win32
  * Documentation changes not done yet
- Updated docs [unreal32docs/example.conf] (maybe not all yet), win zip makefile fixed
- Module coders: I've changed HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_CONNECT, you must now return '0' to let
  the client pass and anything else is threated like a return, so you must return
  FLUSH_BUFFER if you just called exit_client, this fixes a read-already-freed-mem bug.
- Added warning message if set::scan exists
- Made SVSNOOP work. Reported by Lx (#0000933).
- Removed some more html files.
- Removed CREDITS.POTENTIAL
- Removed 'bugreport'
*** beta16 release ***

  (#0000942) reported by Rocko
- Added verification that a vhost::vhost is valid (#0000924) reported by AngryWolf and ChRiS
- Fixed "make install" error caused by bugreport file removal.
- Removed some leftover +I code (can_stealth/^).
- Fixed a badword::action block bug with regex (non-fast) badwords, could cause a crash,
  reported by auspice (#0000946).
- Fixed unprecise RPING output at windoze, reported by pak (#0000945).
- Fixed a bug where operoverride notices were not send when overriding chmodes +aq (#0000831)
  reported by _SciFi_
- Fixed a bug in SVSMODE with setting -b on a user in a channel
- Recoded the "version flag" system, it is now safe to have multiple modules that use the 
  same flag, new functions are VersionflagAdd and VersionflagDel they replace flag_add and
  flag_del
- Fixed a local /kill bug during connection phase, reported by Gilou (#0000952).
- Fixed ripemd-160 vs ripemd160 confusion, reported by thelight (#0000949).
- Little find_client() audit.
- Removed some leftover TECHAT references (#0000953).
- Added a CommandExists function to be used by module coders to determine if a command already
  exists.
- Renamed channel mode +a to "channel admin" it fits better, and it makes us more consistent 
  with other IRCds.
- Made the command parsing loop slightly faster by validating command parameters when a command
  is created rather than when a command is used.
- Made ban version {} also listen for CTCP SCRIPT replies. Some scripts apparently use this to
  report their version info.
- Made it so NETINFO won't report a different cloak key error if the server specifies * for the
  cloak keys. Useful for services that rely on VHP.
- Misc /whois and webtv whois fixes
- Added CASEMAPPING=ascii as per request
- /WHO code cleanup + partial recode + bugfixes
- Updated example.conf about U-lines since many people set them wrong.
- Fixed numeric checking.
- Moved /stats zip from NOTICE to RPL_TEXT, updated stats documentation.
- Made it so it is no longer necessary to copy the ModuleInfo structure passed to Mod_Test
  and Mod_Init. Unreal now does this internally.

- And another minor +L fix.
- Minor channelmode +f fix.
- IPv6: Fixed unable-to-resolve-bug if both a A/AAAA record and NS/MX/etc records were present
  for the same hostname, reported by Byte (#0000972).
- Updated flags in /version (and greeting), added 'Z' for zip links support, updated tech doc.
- Added set::ident::connect-timeout (default 10s) and set::ident::read-timeout (default 30s) to
  have much more control over ident timeouts, this should also fix connection timeout problems
  during connecting.
- Updated example.conf (added throttle block).
- Made some fixes to the resolver code under Win32
- Fixed a bug in del_throttling_bucket 
- Code cleanup (sys_errlist[])
- Fixed a crash in SVSMOTD that could occur if invalid parameters were used. Reported by 
  emigrant
- Committed little de-Fizzer module to extras/
- Check in autoconf for MacOS X that will make compiling and running on it 
  to work
- Possibly fixed a compile problem on Solaris/SunOS (#0000984) reported by Dom
- Added deny channel::redirect, which allows you to forward a client to another channel
  if the one he/she joined is not allowed. can also be used for channel "aliases" like
  #operhelp sends people to #help
- Made it so Unreal always uses extended regex support
- Fixed the compile problem on Solaris/SunOS (#0000984) reported by Dom
- Updated src/win32/unrealinst.iss a bit
- Changed /who flag '&' to '?'
- Fixed regex detection problem (introduced by a change 2 days ago).
- Added set::options::mkpasswd-for-everyone to let normal users use /mkpasswd, requested
  by Evats.
- Added error messages if not oper for: sdesc, mkpasswd, htm, rping, opermotd (#0000988).
- Removed the old TSP stuff from the extras directory, this is no longer used and it just
  wastes space.
- Made /whois work slightly faster
- Probably fixed server-notices bug (duplicates, to non-opers) caused by a few SVS* cmds,
  reported by _loco_ (#0000991).
- Fixed a bug in the win32 editor reported by ChAoS^TiGeR
- Fixed /map bug that permitted trivial finding of U-lined servers
- Fixed bug in HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_JOIN which could cause 0-member-channels if a hook returned
  1 and the channel was new.
- Made it so a permanent /kline no longer says "Permanent Timed K:line" which can be confusing
  (#0000997) reported by AngryWolf
- Module coders: new hooks: part, kick, chanmode, topic. changed: quit (added 'comment' param).
- Enlarged REPORT_* vars a bit.
- IPv6: UnrealIRCd can now lookup ip6.arpa addresses too (original IRCnet patch modified for
  UnrealIRCd by Onliner).
- Doc updates
- Removed "Duplicate user entry in SJOIN" notice because the problem has been traced down.
- Fixed some ./Config problems on Solaris with IPv6, SSL, and some other misc. things 
  (#0001004) reported by lion.
- Changed the /whois "secret channel" flag from '~' to '?'
- Fixed some MOTD problems: remote MOTD gone after rehash (#0001007) and motd time, etc...
- Fixed _some_ gcc3.3 + -Wall warnings.
- Fixed a bug where the win32 config editor could crash if the file contained color codes.
- Resolver fix nr #1 (prolly not "the real problem").
- Minor oob fix for parse_v4_netmask
- Fixed another serious bug in the win32 resolver.
- Removed mutex stuff from rem_request, no longer needed, should make the resolver much
  faster.
- Implemented short motds (ircd.smotd). If you don't know what short motds are, read on:
   short motds are a method of conserving bandwidth. When a user connects ircd.smotd
   is displayed (or a tld::shortmotd). This file contains brief text. Alternatively,
   ircd.motd (or tld::motd) is displayed when a user types /motd. The idea behind this is
   instead of displaying huge ASCII art, and tons of text to every user when they connect
   (since most users will ignore it anyway) you only show that stuff to users who specifically
   request it. Also, if you choose not to use short motds, everything will function as it used
   to the ircd.motd (or tld::motd) will be displayed both when users connect and /motd.
- Changed a few messages so that they use PRIVMSG when being sent to a WebTV user rather than
  using NOTICE.
- Added the TRE regex library to extras/tre (minor modifications to reduce source size)
- Made ./Config configure, compile, and install TRE
- Implemented +a/+q prefixes (#define PREFIX_AQ in config.h) read the comment above PREFIX_AQ
  in include/config.h for more information.
- Fixed PRIVMSG bug with multiple targets.
- Yet another resolver fix
- Fixed a bug with using crontab
- Docs update
- Temporarily disabled compiling TRE 
*** Unreal3.2-beta17 release *** (god save us)
- Modified './update', now points to docs until we have a new update thingy.
- Fixed bug with /list and '?' wildcard, reported by maGGus.
- Fixed a few fdlist bugs in SVSMODE/SVS2MODE found by Aither.
- IPv6: added warning if a ::ffff:a.b.c.d type addr doesn't work since this "feature"
  is disabled by default at newer *BSD versions. Also improved another warning.
- Added set::channel-command-prefix to allow channel text which starts with specific characters
  to be sent to +d clients (for in channel commands).
- Added a README
- Added some checking in fdlist add/remove functions.
- Updated docs a bit (how-to-get-support/FAQ link style).
- Rewrote the win32 editor handling of mIRC codes. The new system should be more stable,
  and it supports more features, such as background colors. Just a note, the editor should
  be able to display any mIRC code without problem, however, some codes may be changed once
  you save the file. For example, reverse is replaced with ctrl+k0,1 and color code 99 is 
  treated as a 1 if used for a text color and 0 if used for a bgcolor. This might cause
  problems when displaying in some clients, however not all clients support color code 99.
  As for the reverse, if I can come up with a decent way to still keep the original reverse
  code, I will change it to do that. So in short, if you need the color codes to stay
  _exactly_ the way they are, then you shouldn't use the editor on that file. Also, color 
  codes that are 0..9 are translated to 2 digits, ie "2" becomes "02" this is to prevent 
  problems when a number follows directly after the color code. 
- Added support for editting short motds in the win32 editor.
- Added a goto button on the win32 editor toolbar.
- Made the win32 editor window maximizable.
- Added a find text feature to the win32 editor.
- Added HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_OPER (first param = aClient of oper, second param = 1 if the user
  just became an oper, 0 if they just -o'ed)
- Added a system to allow modules to create snomasks using functions SnomaskAdd and SnomaskDel
- Fixed ban version crash and another read-after-free.
- Fixed problem with make custommodule and multiple EXLIBS arguments (EXLIBS="-la -lb -lc").
- Fixed a bug with +b and +e involving how trimming should occur when a mask is too long.
  (#0001103) reported by Troco.
- Fixed a bug in aliases reported by darko``
- Updated help.conf and unreal32docs.html (#0001111) reported by SciFi, AngryWolf, and Zerwas.
- Cleaned up some code for /die under Windows
- Fixed ircd.c compile error discovered by Ravage
- Made unreal work with Linux under PPC (#0001105,#0000929) reported by drevlan and Cruiser
  and thanks to drevlan for donating a linux ppc shell to help track down the problem
- Fixed a problem where Unreal would sometimes die without outputting information about the
  crash under Windows
- Made /restart work under Windows in NT service mode.
- Fixed a documentation typo (#0001027) reported by Soldier007
- Fixed a bunch of logging problems reported by LRL (#0001034).
- Fixed a problem with a fix for +b/+e reported by AngryWolf (#0001117)
- Fixed a documentation typo reported by Z3l3zT (#0001066)
- Clarified what ban server {} does, suggested by Joolz (#0001110)
- Fixed a problem related to crontab reported by LRL (#0001034)
- Fixed a problem in PPC detection
- Will now error at too large cloak keys (2147483647 and greater) because it's dangerous
  and could cause cloak key differences (ex: mixed ia32&ia64 networks).
- Some minor text/documentation fixes.
- First big part of modulized extended channelmodes system:
  - Adds room for at least 32 (new) channel modes.
  - Supports both paramless and 1-parameter modes.
  - Modulized: modules can add new channelmodes, but are unloadable (permanent).
  - Everything is ifdef'd, and EXTCMODE is disabled by default in config.h
  - It will send CHANMODES= in the PROTOCTL message on server link, this enables
    servers and services to see which modes are supported and of what type
    they are (1-parameter, paramless, etc).
  And now the bad part:
  - The system has not been fully tested, it will contain bugs (for example I'm
    aware of some memory leaks).
  - A few features are missing: warning/error on linking if chanmodes mismatch, unloading
    of channel modes (not planned soon), 005 broadcasts on change and maybe more..
  - The function (and maybe variable) names will be changed in the next weeks/months
  - You should be carefull with parameter modes + services. Things will get desynced
    if services don't recognize it's a parameter mode. This also applies to clients
    without 005 CHANMODES= support.
  - No documentation

  I really suggest module coders to wait a few weeks till the system is ready..
  In the meantime, don't report bugs or ask for support on this.
- Fixed bug with SWHOIS: oper::swhois wasn't broadcasted correctly which made it
  only show up in local (or server) /whois, reported by format (#0001141).
- minor m_kick tweak.
- Fixed bug in /silence regarding cloaked hosts, reported by kuwatog (#0001157).
- Fixed a problem with a Sleep call on win32
- Rewrote the /stats system. The new system allows for long flags for example
  /stats gline to list glines rather than just /stats G (old flags are still
  supported). Additionally, for glines an extended syntax is now supported allowing
  more refined searches. /stats G +m *@*.aol.com lists only glines that match that 
  mask. For more info do /stats ?. 
- Added stats flags for except throttle and ban version blocks
- stats bugfixes: a null pointer crash and a '/stats k' bug.
- Fixed a couple of problems in the new stats system
- Fixed another stats problem, reported by Angrywolf (#0001163)
- Rewrote the usermode module interface to be more stable and consistent with other
  module functions. New functions are UmodeAdd and UmodeDel (backwards compatibility
  is available for the old functions).
- Fixed a bug in the snomask and umode system dealing with removing flags
- Added two module functions ModuleGetOptions and ModuleSetOptions to retrieve/toggle
  module options
- Fixed a bug effecting +k/+L where you could /mode #chan +k test, /mode #chan +k test
  and each time it would send a mode change (#0001170) reported by Airnike.
- A few documentation updates/fixes
- 005 CHANMODES= set back to original value before extcmode merge
- made some functions in channel.c non-static so module coders
  can use them (they are not defined in the header files [yet] however).
- fixed 2 minor oob write issues
- Fixed a bug with stats l/L
- Updated example.conf with a more strict default oper-only-stats.
- Made '/stats S' and '/stats Z' oper only again (always).
- Hopefully fixed incoming/outgoing rate in /stats T. Only the stats of the first
  listener was counted instead of the total. This also explains why on some (many?)
  ircd configurations it always showed 0.00 kb/s and why HTM (high traffic mode)
  was never kicking in.
- A few doc updates (example.conf).
- Added EOS command (End Of Sync), which is sent between servers after a server has
  succesfully synced (after introducing of channels, users, etc). This way we can
  easily distinct between linked servers and a connecting server.
  This is needed / very helpful for: snomask +F, new +f anti flood system, prolly
  other things as well. Services don't support this command, but it's not
  needed atm since +F/+f both ignore U lines.
- Internal: changed 2 MyMalloc's to MyMallocEx (mem zerofill).. nothing was currently
  affected by this but it's easy to forget if you add new stuff.
- Fixed minor /WALLOPS bug reported by Praetorian_ (#0001195).
- Internal code cleanups: EOS var rename, got rid of old UnknownUser structs, moved
  anti away flood to new flood struct.
- Changed away flood configuration to set::anti-flood::away-flood <count>:<period>.
- Added nickflood protection, can be set in set::anti-flood::nick-flood <count>:<period>
  to allow max 'count' nickchanges per 'period' seconds. The default is 3 per 60s.
  As usual, the nickchange limiting does not apply to ircops.
- Allow o/a/q'd users to nickchange if banned (#0001150).
- Added badword all { }, this will add the badword to the badword channel, badword message
  and badword quit lists... could be useful :p.
- Little config.h cleanup (removed obsolete non-working defines).
- Allow opers to talk in channel even if +m (#0001109).
- Implemented the *nix resolver under windows. This should solve 90% of the problems that
  exist in the Windows version. There may be some problems with the resolver that still
  need to be worked out, however it should be much more stable than before. Some of this
  code is based on the ircu Windows NT port by run.
- Fixed a problem with /quote dns i
- Rewrote a whole bunch of stuff in the extcmode code
- Extended the module system to allow better error reporting using ModuleGetError and
  ModuleGetErrorStr
- Changed channel mode +f, it's a much more advanced antiflood mode now.
  It can protect against joinfloods, ctcpfloods, nickfloods and message/notice floods.
  For example +f [10j]:15 allows 10 joins per 15 seconds, if the limit is reached the
  channel is set automatically +i (invite only) by the server.
  You can read more about it in section 3.12 'Anti-Flood features' of unreal32docs.html:
  http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/unreal32docs.html#feature_antiflood
  This change can cause desynch problems if both old+f and new+f servers are used on
  a network. It's (currrently!) possible to use the old +f system if you undef NEWCHFLOODPROT
  in include/config.h.
- Fixed ~5 compiler warnings at *NIX and ~20 at windows. Some of them _could_ have caused problems.
- Moved EOS debugging code to DEBUGMODE.
- Fixed a channel sync bug reported by thilo&Rocko (#0001218).
- Fixed minor config parser memleak reported by AngryWolf (#0001214).
- Fixed bug regarding hidden opers + m_whois cleanup (#0001208).
- Made SSL users unable to -z themselves, also added 2 flags to /stats S,
  reported by Joolz (#0001200).
- Fixed problem with opers having both 'admin' and 'coadmin' causing double-notices (#0001043).
- +f now also allows you to specify an 'action'. For example +f [30j#R]:15 will set the
  channel +R (instead of +i) if more than 30 joins in 15 seconds are reached.
  The following combinations are allowed: c#m, c#M, j#R and m#M. (docs will be updated later)
- Probably fixed a bug regarding 'setting mode' notice with +f (was sometimes sent to non-chanops).
- Fixed multiple chmode +u bugs: remote join, netjoin, +mu relay between servers, kick and
  a part bug. Most of them reported by Lx (#0001097).
- Fixed a bug in +f + modes-on-join + 't' subfloodtype, reported by Rocko (#0001228).
- Fixed a crashbug with +f and services, reported by Rocko (#0001227).
- And another +f + modes-on-join one...
- Made anti away flood system work just like anti nick flood (#0001205).
  NO_FLOOD_AWAY is now enabled and away-flood is set to 4 per 120s by default.
- Fixed a double OperOverride notice bug reported by DukePyrolator (#0001180).
- Doc fixes/updates reported by Angrywolf (#0001163, #0001176).
- Fixed a /rehash crash regarding badword all & regex badwords, reported by Angrywolf (#0001230).
- Fixed an old bug where allow::hostname localhost (or *@localhost) didn't work (#0001115).
- Fixed a chroot bug, reported by iceblade (#0001112).
- Badwords filtering is now only done for local clients, previously every server was filtering
  the message. This will reduce CPU usage, especially at hubs (#0001022).
- Will now strip/block color codes in quits if any channel the user is in has mode +S/+c.
- Temporarely added trace code for hunting down negative operator counts (#0001155).
- Made it so that with +M and user not +r and not voice/halfop/ops/etc the part message isn't
  shown, just like with +m.
- Added warn option to deny channel, this will send a notice to the eyes snomask when a user
  attempts to join. Suggested by Joolz (#0000992).
- Added clientsonly/serversonly/ssl/java flags to /stats P (#0000992).
- Added official-channels block. These channels are listed in /list even if they have 0 users.
- Fixed a crashbug introduced by +mu fixes 3 days ago (#0001237).
- Fixed a typo where /knock would say the channel is +I if +V is set, reported by Certus
- Improved SSL error msg sent to junk snomask.
- Fixed Q:lined nickname msgs during linking and a debug fix.
- Fixed a SVSMOTD crashbug (removing of motd).
- Fix-for-fix-for-+mu-fix (it was still crashing)... don't ask.
- Minor +f code tweaks.
- Added checks for ipv4 listen lines on ipv6 compile.
- Finished some of the extcmode code (memleaks).
- Fixed a problem in the new win32 resolver code
- Added HOOKTYPE_UNKUSER_QUIT (disconnects of unregistered clients).
- Fixed a Linux PPC problem (#0001242)
- Made the win32 version use libtre for regex rather than GNU regex
  libtre is smaller, faster, and more feature rich.
- Fixed some issues regarding unsetting of -R/-M when server set that mode due to a flood (+f),
  it would set the mode back immediately after next msg/join, counters are now reset.
- Updated documentation
- Added set::default-bantime. It allows you to set the default time for a gline/kline/gzline/
  shun/etc when the time is not not specified (like with /gline *@*.stupid.net).
- Added HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_PASS and HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_CONNECT
- Added HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_QUIT
- Added beta18 release notes (might be changed)
- Added HOOKTYPE_REHASHFLAG (triggered when /rehash is passed a flag)
- Fix for HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_QUIT (was called for local quits too)
- Redid the join/kick/topic hooks
- Added a few macros (MOD_HEADER, MOD_INIT, MOD_TEST, MOD_LOAD, MOD_UNLOAD) to make
  setting up a module for both static and dynamic linking easier
- Fixed a win32 resolver lockup bug
- Fixed hunt_server* bug
- Very Very small change to doc/example.conf
- Updated .CHANGES.NEW to read Beta18
- Minor doc update.
- Updated all the modules to use the new macros
- Changed version to 'beta18'
- Fixed a problem with tre.dll
- Rewrote some of the message searching code to make it roughly 25% faster
- Minor botmotd-on-mode+B fix.
- Added a "command override" system for modules (experimental)
- Fixed some documentation typos (#0001273) reported by AngryWolf
- Fixed a bug where SVSNOOP could cause negative oper counts
- Fixed even more negative oper count bugs:
  1) if services would do a '-o' via svsmode/svs2mode on a +H person (instead of -oH)
  2) services setting +H on a non-oper
  3) services making someone a global oper while he's already local op might cause confusion.
  4) if local opers would do /mode nick +H
  5) Some false warnings (negative opercount) if services would do -Ho (-oH went fine)
- Fixed a problem with HTM where it would never actually read messages from clients
- Made /who limit output (uses set::who-limit) (#0001244) suggested by Exael23 
- Made /who * disabled (for non-opers) in HTM mode
- Added usermode +T - No CTCP (excludes ACTION and DCC), (#001288) suggested by White_Magic
  and others.
- Optimized the channel privmsg/notice code again (sendto_channelprefix_butone_tok),
  now ~33% faster.
- Yet another code audit:
  - (Just for the record, this audit has nothing to do with the ircnet buffer overflow,
     unrealircd is not vulnerable)
  - Various fixes
  - Visual bug regarding +f & server synching, it was sometimes setting mode +f multiple
    times depending on the ban-/userlist.
  - Fixed a possible desynch regarding chmode +L.
  - Fixed possible client confusion regarding bans.
- Now it would be even better if it actually compiles...
- Optimized send code re-enabled, I disabled it 6h ago due a bug-triggering-a-bug (see next).
- Fixed a PING bug resulting in 'trying to send .. to myself' msg.
- Some spelling corrections in unreal32docs.html.
- Added checks for /sethost&/chghost to same host.
- Added remove-chanmode-after-X-minutes in +f.
  The format is +f [30j#R5]:15, where 5 is the "do -R after 5 minutes". For a default
  action like +i you would have to do the same: +f [30j#i5]:15 (remove 'i' after 5 minutes).
  Additionally, 2 config items are added:
  - set::modef-default-unsettime, if this is set to for example '5' then things like
    +f [30j]:15 will be transormed into +f [30j#i5]:15. It's just a default, the user can still
    override it. By default this feature is not used.
  - set::modef-max-unsettime, specifies the maximum amount of time for the <time> parameter,
    by default this is set to 60 (=1 hour), the value should be between 0 and 255.
  I didn't do the extended tests I usually do but it seems stable, also the docs are updated
  but are probably updated again later to make it a bit more readable.
  Feel free to report any bugs as soon as you discover them.
  The only thing I could think of is: _usually_ only 1 server will have the -i/-R/.. timer
  running, so if that server splits (or even worse dies) it will only be -i/-R/.. at that server
  and when they sync back they merge chanmodes so +i/+R is set again.
  I don't consider this a huge problem but maybe it can be inconveniently, if people have
  a lot of trouble with this I'll have to consider a 50% recode of the +f system :/.
- Fixed gline with weird value causing a crash at windows, reported by Spectre (#0001309).
- Fix for +L without +l desynch on serverlinking.
- Fixed a problem regarding module hooks, if a hook was called within a hook it could cause
  problems (like pre connect hook -> exit_client -> quit hook).
- Changed some useless stuff.
- Enabled EXTCMODE by default, I presume it's stable but can't promise anything.
- Module coders: changed 'allowed' callback function for umodes&snomasks,
  from 'aClient *sptr' to 'aClient *sptr, int what'.
  'what' will be MODE_ADD if trying to add and MODE_DEL if trying to remove.
- Added HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_NICKCHANGE (called like: cptr, sptr, newnick).
- Fixed a bug regarding +f and bounce modes, would cause a crash, reported by Rocko.
- Made it so the dccdeny system can now check files that contain spaces (suggested by
  Lamego)
- Added set::options::allow-part-if-shunned. Sometimes shunned users close a channel
  window, most irc clients just close the window immediately and send a part msg..
  they don't wait for the server to confirm the part and thus the user thinks he has left
  the channel while in fact he has not... this can be annoying if you are temporarely
  shunning n00bs for a few minutes, they won't understand why they get a 'You are already
  on that channel' error msg when they try to join that chan again.
  This is however disabled by default because the idea of shun is to totally shun a user
  so (s)he can't do anything except /admin (and thus not causing "any" [server]traffic).
  Suggested by brentos. Note that we won't support /quit, or any other command, just this.
- Module coders: Moved call to HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_JOIN down to where the JOIN, NAMES, etc
  are already sent... this seems to make more sense since we have a prejoin hook now.
- Moved it a bit too far (outside the loop), should be fixed now.
- Fixed bug where color quits were stripped when they shouldn't be >:).
- Added 'action' field to ban version { } which can be: kill: kills the user (default),
  tempshun: shun the specific connection only, kline/zline/gline/gzline/shun: place
  a ban on *@IP. Time of those bans can be specified in set::ban-version-tkl-time.
  It's up to the admin to take a good decision, sometimes zlines are best (=won't use
  much sockets but will reconnect quite quickly), sometimes tempshun (=will use 1 socket
  but generates nearly no network traffic), sometimes klines/glines, etc..
- Added sendto_umode_raw, sends to umodes, but not as a NOTICE
- Added hook HOOKTYPE_CHANNEL_CREATE (cptr(user creating channel), chptr
  (channel that has gotten created)
- Added hook HOOKTYPE_CHANNEL_DESTROY (chptr (channel getting destroyed))
- Minor doc updates regarding snomasks reported by Stoebi (#0001324).
- Fixed two OperOverride kick bugs:
  - If ircop is +h and victim is +h it would deny it, reported by Special (#0001308)
  - Ircops (all except netadmin) had trouble kicking +q people, if the ircop isn't
    op'ed he can kick them, but if he has +o he can't. Reported by Michi (#0001012).
  If you use mixed unreal versions you can get desynch problems if you use those
  fixed things (like kick a +h if you are +h) because older servers will still block
  the kick. You will receive a 'You cannot kick channel' message from every older
  server so you'll at least be notified ;p.
- Don't allow remote pongs if unregistered.
- (Internal) Added __attribute__ format checking for most format string functions,
  this will currently produce a lot of warnings with -Wall.
- Fixed 159 of 184 warnings detected by the above, the other warnings are false.
  Most warnings had to do with long vs int, and thus the format strings (%d->%ld)
  or the vars (int->long) have been changed (many of these were time_t/TS vs int).
  Only a few rare crashbugs were discovered.
- Module coders: for HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_CHANMODE the 'sendts' parameter was changed
  from type 'int' to 'time_t', while in most circumstances (like on ia32)
  you won't notice, I suggest you to update your callback functions anyway.
- Possibly fixed an issue with set::modes-on-join and mode +f, it could have
  set random remove-chanmode times in the default chanmode line.
- Fixed some other weird remote PING/PONG stuff as well.
- Fixed a bug where link::options::autoconnect wasn't working after rehash, ircd
  had to be restarted to make it work. Will now try to connect on /rehash to
  servers with autoconnect enabled. Bug was reported by Rocko (#0001321).
- Added insane OperOverride system for joining +z channels (#0001189).
  This seems better than just allowing the insecure oper trough +z.
- Fixed a UMODE2 bug.
- Made it so chanmode +f flood detection doesn't apply to u-lined servers. This was
  already indirectly the case because services don't support the EOS command, but
  now some (homemade) services do :p. Reported by Troco (#0001337).
- (Internal) Moved most valid-host checking into 1 function, valid_host(),
  which checks for invalid characters.
- Added hostname check for me::name since this could cause mysterious trouble.
- Removed references to tkline/tzline from help.conf. Reported by penna22 (#0001340)
- Fix for permanent modules w/ config hooks (they were not called).
- Fixed desynch bug regarding extended channelmodes. Reported by AngryWolf (#0001347)
- Multiple /module changes (the command):
  - Normal users can now get a list, versioninfo will be hidden however.
  - Opers get some additional details like hooks and commandoverride's.
  - Opers can use /module <servername> to get a remote list of loaded modules.
  - Added flag [3RD] to show it's a 3rd party module
  This was requested by by quite some people because serveradmins started to load
  "spy modules" without clearly mentioning it in the MOTD (which is highly unethical
  and in some countries even illegal due to privacy law). Also the remote module
  list was requested by quite a few opers.
  Sure, this isn't a 100% guarantee but at least if someone goes hiding stuff
  then it's clear what their intentions are (and thus will be refused support, ..).
- Changed emailaddr in help window at windows to unreal-users mailinglist.
- Made the cloak mismatch msg during linking a bit more scary.
- Added comment to 'Install as a service' option in installer to help n00bs a bit.
- Made win32 work again (broke it by /module patch 30 minutes ago).
- Fixed a snomask issue reported by Magnet (#0001354).
- Added oper::maxlogins which allows you to limit the number of concurrent session
  with the same oper block. Suggested by kain.
- Made /dns oper-only (the ircd command, not your client /dns command :p).
- Various help.conf fixes. Reported by nukie (#0001373).
- Fixed remote BOTMOTD bug reported by Angrywolf (#0001365).
- Workaround for "special ban makes it impossible to add other bans" bug
  reported by wilkie, SerialKillinNinja, etc. 
- Made /rehash reread botmotd and opermotd (#0001291).
- Made OperOverride work for chanmode +Q (#0001370).
- A few example.conf changes.
- Fixed a compile problem on alpha, reported by Hyperi (#0001374).
- Made "operator count bug" not notice all opers (log only), unless in debugmode.
- Added comment regarding MLOCK and set::restrict-chanmodes in unreal32docs.html.
- Made PREFIX_AQ a ./Config question at *NIX and enabled it by default at Win32.
- Added stuff that will ease the transition to extended bans next release.
- Added beta19 release notes
- Made USE_ZIP the default again in src/win32/unrealinst.iss
- Changed version to beta19
- A last-minute fix, lalala...
*** beta19 release ***
- Changed the HOOKTYPE_REHASHFLAG syntax to (aClient *cptr, aClient *sptr, char *flag)
  requested by AngryWolf (#0001365)
- Added HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_PART to allow changing of part messages suggested by AngryWolf
  (#0001365)
- Fixed a bug with SVSNLINE - reported by FreakyComputer and fixed by AngryWolf 
  (#0001399)
- example.conf: added +i in modes-on-connect.
- Temporarely added fdlist debugcode, please report any bugreports it gives,
  it would especially be helpful if you know _what_ triggered the error :).
- '/rehash <server>' didn't reload motds&rules files, reported by w00t (#0001409).
- Added channelmode +T: no notices allowed in channel.
- Made ./Config create a tmp/ directory
- Rewrote some of the module system to allow /rehash to load a new version of a module i.e.
  after a newer version has been compiled. This also fixes the problem with hooks disappearing
  during a rehash (#0001332) reported by AngryWolf and (#0001325) reported by Cnils. This
  might need some testing.
- Fixed some problems with the copyfile routine for the new module rehash system and also fixed
  an issue with rehashing when permanent modules are loaded
- Made "chanop notices" only go to @#chan on non-prefixaq servers (and to ~&@#chan otherwise),
  internal: added ugly macro CHANOPPFX which is "~&@" if prefix_aq, else "@".
- Added error checking/error messages to new module reloading system, to catch errors like
  insufficient hd space, permission denied, etc..
- Made it compile at windows again
- Added set::static-part: similar to static-quit, default 'no' (static-part disabled).
  If set to 'yes' or '1' it will strip all part comments,
  if set to something else it will use that as a part comment.
- Partial cleanup of m_part (hopefully I didn't destroy anything).
- Minor stats compile warning fixed
- Started some work on the remote include system
- Fixed a bug with set::who-limit sending multiple error notices, reported by doh
- Fixed a bug with the configure script reported by doh where Unreal would ignore the
  manually specified directory for OpenSSL (and also Zlib)
- Made the ./configure --help display a bit cleaner
- Added include/types.h to hold any new datatypes we create
- A lot more work on the remote include system
- Added a patch by Certus to make it so hide-ulines also hides the server name from a
  /who /whois and /whowas
- Merged all of the win32 makefiles into a single file (makefile.win32) with some
  configurable macros to decide whether ziplinks and/or ssl should be enabled
- Added "extended bans". An idea from SorceryNet ircd.
  These bans look like ~<type>:<stuff>. Currently the following bans are available:
  ~q: quiet bans (ex: ~q:*!*@blah.blah.com). People matching these bans can join
      but are unable to speak, unless they have +v or higher.
  ~c: channel bans (ex: ~c:#idiots). People in #idiots are unable to join the channel.
  ~r: gecos (realname) bans (ex: ~r:*Stupid_bot_script*). If the realname of a user
      matches this then (s)he is unable to join.
      NOTE: an underscore ('_') matches both a space (' ') and an underscore ('_'),
            so this ban would match 'Stupid bot script v1.4'.

  These bantypes can also be used in the channel exception list (+e).
  +e ~r:*w00t* makes anyone with 'w00t' in their realname able to join,
  and +e ~c:#admin makes anyone in #admin able to join, etc..

  This system allows modules to add extended bantypes too.

  This feature requires some additional testing, also the module interface will
  probably be changed in the next few weeks, and perhaps more extended bans will
  be added before next release.. we'll see...
- Updated win32 makefile...
- Module-systemized the extban stuff
- As expected, fixed a crashbug in extended bans system. Reported by Rocko (#0001444).
- internal: changed is_banned() again: cptr,sptr -> sptr (dropped cptr). It was too
  confusing (and thus causing bad code/bugs) and was never used anyway.
- Added a function join_channel which will make it easier for module coders to force users
  to join a channel
- Made it possible to compile the win32 version with libcurl support
- Updated the win32 TRE lib/dll to the latest version (0.6.3)
- Fixed a PATH_MAX vs MAX_PATH problem
- Fixed a bug where if a Mod_Load returned MOD_FAILED, the module was not removed (#0001426)
  reported by AngryWolf
- Fixed a bunch of oper fdlist bugs regarding locops
- Fixed a couple of minor typos in the source
- Removed the old configure checks for pthreads
- Added configure/Config stuff for libcurl
- Added a ./curlinstall script to help with installing curl (Read INSTALL.REMOTEINC for
  more information).

- Fixed a remote include compile bug on Linux regarding url.h
- Fixed a remote include compile bug regarding ares (#0001458) reported by mustapha88
- Made the tmp/ directory cleaned up better
- Added some additional warnings for insane large values for allow::maxperip, and class::*
  stuff. Reported by Erik_Rana (#0001463).
- Fixed a bug with /rehash and cached remote includes reported by mustapha88
- internal: Modified TKL system (getting ready for anti-spam system):
  Instead of 1 big list of *lines, it's now an array to easily distinct between types.
  Also made tk->usermask static (USERLEN+2) instead of dynamic.
  These changes should give enough speed improvement to make the new anti-spam/anti-ads
  feature fast enough.
- Updated the TRE library source to 0.6.3 (not yet used)
- Updated the win32 TRE lib/dll to 0.6.4
- Updated the TRE library source to 0.6.4 (yup, a release right after I do the last upgrade!)
- Removed all the FLAGS_TS8 stuff (no longer used)
- Fixed some operoverride bugs regarding halfops found by Sinus (#0001465)
- Cleaned up the /kick code to make it a bit faster
- Reactivated TRE compile
- Finally made Unreal use TRE under *nix
- Fixed a compile problem reported by ace (#0001474)
- Added an EXTBAN 005 token (see doc/technical/005.txt for info)
- Fixed a bug with the dynamic umode and cmode systems
- Made CmodeAdd return MODERR_EXISTS if the mode already exists
- Fixes for TRE under win32
- Made Extbans use the module object system
- Fixed a problem caused by the previous change
- Fixed some compile warnings
- Made CmodeAdd set MODERR_NOERROR when no error occurs (#0001484) reported by AngryWolf
- Fixed a bug in /kick reported by rav2k (#0001490)
- Made /who +M show +i users since they are already visible (#0001489) reported by penna
- Made /who +M take chmode +u (auditorium) into account
- Corrected the SVSNLINE documentation in help.conf (reported by Certus)
- internal: Ok, I'm committing this in parts... did most of the TKL spamfilter
  integration now, no.. it doesn't work at all yet but most of the internal stuff
  has now been done (but I temporarely need to work on other things now).
   moved/added a lot of regex stuff, banaction/spamfilter helper functions, etc
  into s_misc.c. [note: current code has some bugs but since the stuff isn't
  used that's no problem... it's also a bit ugly, do NOT mail me about these things ;p]
- Enabled talk-trough-+M for opers (just like +m)
- Disabled talk-trough-+m/+M for opers if NO_OPEROVERRIDE is defined
- Display zlib/SSL version in /version (oper only)... will prolly be improved later.
- updated doc/compiling_win32.txt
- updated doc/compiling_win32.txt some more (tre.dll, not gnu_regex.dll)
- Added a patch by AngryWolf to display libcurl info at startup. Also added support to 
  display in /version
- Added a patch by AngryWolf to add ./unreal version (displays the Unreal version)
- Made permanent modules receive HOOKTYPE_REHASH to notify of a rehash (#0001499)
- Added EXBCHK_PARAM to allow reporting errors about bad extban parameters. 
  Requested by AngryWolf (#0001488)
- Added a patch by XeRXeS to log usage of some potentially abusive commands
  (#0001397)
- Renamed "FAKE_LAG_FOR_LOCOPS" to "NO_FAKE_LAG_FOR_LOCOPS" since that's what it did
  anyway, requested by Greg (#0001453)
- Made it so chan ops can invite in a +V channel. Requested by AI (#0001478)
- Added HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_QUIT to allow changing quit messages. Suggested by penna22
  (#0001424)
- Updated some /stats docs, reported by AngryWolf (#0001283)
- Added set::silence-limit to allow specifying how many entries may be in the SILENCE list
  also upped the default value to 15. Suggested by tabrisnet (#0001486)
- Updated the docs to reflect that /module can now be used by users. Reported by fez (#0001434)
- Made it so the configure script doesn't add include/library paths if they would be the 
  default path. Reported by LoVeR (#0001307)
- Changed random number generator to use arc4random-alike routines so we can get "secure"
  random numbers. We will also no longer be using rand()/random() anywhere.
  Thanks to dek\ for pointing out this is potentionally dangerous, especially on
  win32 with NOSPOOF enabled.
- Changed NOSPOOF msg in ./Config a bit since this can also be effective against
  "blind proxies" (like HTTP POST proxies).
- WebTV updates: made it so (user generated) channel notices are now displayed as
  privmsgs in the channel. Also made the /knock channelnotice a privmsg for webtv.
- Module coders: added HOOKTYPE_REMOTE_CHANMODE
- Fixed a bug with HOOKTYPE_CONFIGTEST not being called for permanent modules, found by
  AngryWolf
- Updated PRIVMSG/NOTICE paramcount so '/msg IRC NOTICE #chan hi all' works (no ':').
- Made it so *lines via place_host_ban() take effect immediately (eg for spamfilter,
  ban version, flood from unknown connection), there was a small delay before.
- Added spamfilter system. This is an attempt to fight spam, advertising, worms, etc..
  It's much like badwords but allows you to choose multiple targets (eg: private,
  channel, notice, etc) and various actions (eg: block, kline, gline, kill, etc).
  You can use the /spamfilter command to add network-wide spamfilters, but you
  can also use spamfilter { } config blocks to create local spamfilters.
  Additionally, set::spamfilter::ban-time (duration of *lines added by spamfilter)
  and set::spamfilter::ban-reason (*line reason if banned) are added.
  See the documentation for more information (section 3.14).
  This system needs some additional testing, I'm sure there will be bugs ;).
- Fixed a problem with /stats [G|s] extended flags parsing.
- internal: added sendnotice()
- win32 compile fix (typo)
- added set::spamfilter::* to docs
- updated /stats help and docs on '/stats f'
- Fixed '/SetHost Error' flood from all servers in some circumstances like re-opering,
  reported by blotter45 (#0001400).
- Made ./Config remember the libcurl directory, reported by ace (#0001505).
- Fixed a problem with the snprintf() check, reported by virusx (#0001510).
- Fixed a bug where multiple spaces could appear in a MODE message, reported by Airnike
  (#0001169).
- Fixed a bug with SSL remaining enabled even when the headers are not found, reported by
  AngryWolf (#0000863)
- Added can_setq/q for regulating which opers can set umode +q, requested by cfreak202
  (#0000478)
- Added HOOKTYPE_TKL_EXCEPT (arg: cptr, tkline) which is called from find_tkline_match
  and find_tkline_match_zap. This can be used to add custom TKL exceptions.
- Fixed possible compile bug (caused by HOOKTYPE_TKL_EXCEPT).
- Cosmetic 'stats /zip' output change (#0001435).
- Made services admins able to see on which channel services bots are, just
  like netadmins can, suggested by EviL_SmUrF (#0001481).
- Fixed problems with Unreal using devices in a chroot'ed environment and ircd.pid problems
  with setuid/setgid, reported by thilo (#0001514).
- Made /sajoin override modes (e.g. +bilk) reported by mcskaf (#0000518).
- Fixed issue when 2 servers link with identical user@host *:lines but with different
  expire times, reason field, etc... Entries are now fully synced between servers.
  Reported by Cnils (#0001448).
- Added umode +T to help.conf
- Fixed an issue with add/del/remove in /spamfilter being case sensitive.
- Fixed invalid nameserver info when chrooted (nameserver was always localhost).
- Fixed a remote include bug involving cached files. Thanks to chatsphere.net for helping to
  track this down!
- Modified 404 numeric a bit (#0001515).
- Fixed 'no server notice on /restart or /die', reported by Lx (#0001062). This was caused
  by a bug in flush_connections(&me), hopefully there won't be any side effects.
- Fixed file owner problems when IRC_UID/IRC_GID is used (eg: when running chrooted).
- Fixed crashbug if we were unable to write a remote include file to disk.
- Limited 'All Connections in Use' message to max 1 every 15s, this DOES NOT mean we will
  introduce throttling of other msgs (or making this configurable)... this is just
  an exception because this msg is sent to _all opers_ and you cannot disable it by
  unsetting certain snomasks. Anything lower than 15s would be bad anyway since this
  is a very serious error condition. Requested by LoVeR (#0001412).
- Added can_dccdeny operflag so you can give your local/global opers access to this too.
  Co-admin, admin, sadmin and netadmin get it by default. Suggested in #0001247.
- Updated operflag docs.
- '/rehash -all' had bugs and is now considered depricated, just use '/rehash' instead.
  On '/rehash' we reload everything already so the '-all' option was useless anyway.
  Reported by fez (#0001516).
- Made blocked dcc notices (sent to umode +v) global, suggested by neothematrix (#1513).
- [internal] cleaned up snomask removal after deoper, now remove_oper_snomasks() is
  called which might look a bit ugly, but is better than before (scattered on 3 places).
- Added snomasks 'N' which allows you to see nick changes of clients on other servers,
  requested by several people (#0001323).
- Made setting of -qaohv etc on services (+S) not possible unless you are a netadmin (purpose
  is to prevent people from deoping BotServ bots). Suggested by shiny (#0000917)
- Ripped out fast (bad)words support out of spamfilter to avoid confusion, also renamed
  spamfilter::word to spamfilter::regex to make it even more clear (since we match
  on the whole line and have nothing to do with words.. 'word' doesn't make sense).
- Updated docs with some better regex examples, reported by AngryWolf (#0001520).
- Added snomasks 'S' (Spamfilter) which notifies you of any spamfilter matches.
- [internal] always return after spamfilter match, don't continue looping trough
  targets list (eg in case of: /msg #a,#b,#c spamspam), otherwise you would get
  duplicate notification msgs.
- Added SENDSNO server command, similar to SENDUMODE but for snomasks, this is
  used by the spamfilter snomask (+S) so you get network-wide notifications.
- Added "compiled for.." versioning system, this way a beta17 module can't be loaded
  on beta18, etc... People often forgot to recompile their modules or had old ones
  somewhere by mistake, therefore crashing after upgrades... this should fix this
  (in the future). Module coders don't have to do anything for making this work,
  it's done automatically (via modules.h).
- Forgot to add src/modules/m_sendsno.c to CVS, also fixed 2 compile warnings
  and a crashbug related to previous commit.. bug hunting will continue ;).
- Fixed minor compile warning.
- Added a section "Security tips/checklist" to unreal32docs.html, this is something
  I worked on a few months ago... It tries to explain how to get a server/network
  secured, what the potential risks are, etc... Of course security is a complex topic
  so I cannot talk about everything in it, but I tried to mention the main risks and
  what you can do about it in a (hopefully) simple and understandable language ;).
- Fixed a snomask bug reported by Cat / HERZ (#0001531).
- Started using the umode->allowed stuff a bit ourselves, just to be sure.
- Fixed a problem with module reloading (#0001533) reported by penna.
- Removed remote /restart support. There are too many security issues that
  can not be overcome. 
- Added a patch by thilo to make Unreal correctly deal with umask settings when
  creating devices in a chroot'ed environment. (#0001514)
- Added commands SVSSNO and SVS2SNO (work just like SVSMODE/SVS2MODE but for snomasks)
  suggested by x64 (#0001461).
- Added 80% of release notes, rest will be added a day before release or so :).
- We are having fun with Makefiles...
- Updated the Donation file to talk about the PayPal address to make donating easier
  (hint hint.. ;)
- Added missing lines to include/setup.h.in for snprintf, vsnprintf, strlcpy, strlcat,
  and strlncat. Should fix #0001510 (for real this time).
- Ouch!! Fixed a severe bug which caused opers not being recognized on remote
  servers causing various problems... This was caused by a change 1-2 days ago.
  Reported by Rocko (#0001537).
- Fixed fdlist bug/warning if a local operator /oper'd up twice. Reported by
  DukePyrolator (#0001539).
- Changed version to RC1
*** RC1 release ***
- Fixed a problem regarding the new module system and deleting the tmp/ directory
  under Linux 2.2 (thanks to FunTeenChat for helping track this down)
- Updated /credits. Now includes everyone who has sent in donations, thanks
  to everyone!
- Fixed a bug in "unkickable users" (umode +q), they could still be kicked
  by non-netadmin ircops in some (many) cases, reported by Zell (#0001541).
- Removed reference to SVSTIME from help.conf (it's actually /tsctl svstime)
  (#0001540) reported by penna and DukePyrolator.
- Added HOOKTYPE_UMODE_CHANGE (sptr, oldflags, newflags) - this may 
  not be accurate as umode changes are done manually many places.
- Added HOOKTYPE_TOPIC (catches both remote and local TOPIC sets).
- Added a missing ; in the docs oper {} example, reported by Certus
- Fixed a bug with leaving out SJB64 in PROTOCTL resulting in strangeness
  (#0001545) reported by MagicalTux2
- Added [OLD?] flag in /module so you can easily spot old beta* modules.
- Modulized: samode, sajoin, sapart, kick, topic, invite, list
- Added HOOKTYPE_REHASH_COMPLETE to allow permanent modules to reload
  command overrides. (#0001553) reported by AngryWolf
- Modulized: time, svskill
- Modulized: sjoin, pass, userhost, ison, silence
- Modulized: knock, umode2, squit, protoctl
- Slightly changed how extcmodes handles access control
- Module coders: for extended channelmodes the EXCHK_ACCESS* the return
  value should now be one of EX_*:
  EX_DENY        : disallowed, except for oper override
  EX_ALLOW       : allowed
  EX_ALWAYS_DENY : disallowed, even in case of operoverride (eg for
                   operlevel modes like +A).
  Note that it's backward compatible since TRUE/EX_ALLOW=1 and FALSE/EX_DENY=0.
- Fixed a few bugs with oper override & extended chanmodes, for example
  chanmode +T could not be set by a globop w/can_override and non-+hoaq.
- Added some set::throttle::* checking if insane values were supplied.
  Reported by Troco (#0001555).
- Added support for single-target specifiction like spamfilter { regex "blah";
  action kill; target private; }; previously it didn't warn/error on this
  but it didn't work either.
- Fixed a bug in the unreal_checkregex() routine which could cause a crash
  if you added an invalid regex. Reported by Tony (#0001556).
- Fixed the problem with services and SETHOST for unknown user errors
  (#0000893) reported by vorte[x]
- Made allow::options::noident work correctly (#0001416) reported by Zifnab
- Made some files include limits.h to find PATH_MAX on Solaris (#0001561)
  reported by lunytune
- Made a change to the remote include code to deal with a random memory corruption
  issue (#0001558) reported by hybridz.
- Fixed a bug caused by the fix to bug (#0000917) that would also prevent you from
  setting +qaohv on a network service (#0001563) reported by Rocko.
- Fixed a few wrong macro's (ircstrdup/ircfree) in s_conf.c causing
  very weird behavior... This also fixes a bug where set::spamfilter::ban-reason
  would have the value of ban-time.
- Improved spamfilter again.
  - The new syntax is:
    /spamfilter [what] [type] [action] [tkltime] [reason] [regex]
    [tkltime] specifies the duration of any *lines placed by this rule.
    [reason] specifies the *line, kill and/or block reason.. no spaces
    allowed, but '_' will be escaped to a space.
    In both cases you can simply use '-' to skip and use the default.
    Ex: /spamfilter add p block - - Come watch me on my webcam
        /spamfilter add p gline 3h Please_go_to_www.viruscan.xx/
        nicepage/virus=blah Come watch me on my webcam
  - A message is now shown if the msg/notice/dcc is blocked.
  - There are 2 new spamfilter action types:
    'dccblock' will mark the user so (s)he's unable to send any files by DCC.
    'viruschan' will part the user from all channels and join
     set::spamfilter::virus-help-channel (default: #help).
     this action might be improved to do more later.
  - Internal: added EXTTKL PROTOCTL, this determinates if 10 parameters
    instead of 8 are supported for m_tkl (used by spamfilter add).
  This new system needs some testing... :)
- Fixed a bug in 'Flood from unknown connection' (#0001566).
- Rewrote a great deal of the remote include code to make it work on Windows
  due to Microsoft insanity. 
- Added /tempshun, temporary shuns the current session of specified nick
  (just like the 'tempshun' in spamfilter and ban version). Suggested by
  Cnils (#0001526). [docs/help.conf will be updated later]
- Updated docs on tempshun and new spamfilter features.
- Modulized: addline, addmotd, addomotd, wallops, globops, locops, chatops,
  admin, trace.
- Removed: gnotice, goper
- Modulized: netinfo, links, help, rules, close, map, eos
- Made it compile on win32 again
- Modulized: server, stats
- Modulized: svsfline, dccdeny, undccdeny, whowas
- Modulized: connect... should be the last one till 3.2final.
- Fixed some compile warnings/problems caused by modulizing.
- Fixed a bug which prevented "/spamfilter del[..]" from working.
  Reported by Fury (#0001575).
- Moved the SQLINE system (and ban nick) to TKL and introduced "holds"
  suggested by Certus
- Minor fix for previous.
- Improved 'viruschan' spamfilter target:
  - better msg after the forced join
  - +oaq's in set::spamfilter::virus-help-channel receive a notice about
    which filter the user matched.
  - it disables all commands except PONG, ADMIN, and msg/notices to
    set::spamfilter::virus-help-channel.
- Made snomask +S also show the spamfilter reason field.
- Added class::pingfreq checking, should be 30-600 now.. else you might
  get mysterious (mass) disconnect issues.
- Lol, I made /connect dissapear during modulizing ;).
- Added a warning if your listen portrange affects >100 ports
  (eg for idiots doing 6667-7000 which uses 333 sockets).
- Added some extra debugging for tkl update notice...
- Fixed a problem in 'tkl update': lowest expire time won instead of
  highest. Reported by Malcolm.
- Fixed a tkl update problem with sqlines
- Improved dcc blocking support (both for spamfilter and deny dcc).
- '0' tkltime in spamfilter now really means 'perm', not '*line for
  0 seconds' or something. Reported by Certus.
- Fixed a bug in individual m_*.so loading, 39 new modules were affected.
- Fixed an issue where chanmode +f was often set by the server again
  in a netjoin when there was no need to (nothing to synch).
- Added spamfilter::except which allows you to specify targets
  (eg: channels) where spamfilter should not take action. Requested by Fury
  (#0001586). Ex: set { spamfilter { except "#spamreport,#help"; }; };
- Fixed a zero-terminate bug in remote includes: urls with '?' in it could
  cause a crash, reported by Joolz (#0001587).
- Made numerics 518-520 a bit more clear by mentioning the channelname in it.
  Suggested by Zell (#0001589).
- Fixed a bug reported by Joolz that would cause problems when deleting a remote
  included file from a server (#0001587).
- Fixed a few more remote include problems on Windows
- Fixed a remote include problem caused by an earlier fix that resulted in referencing
  free'd memory 
- Q comes after P. Thanks to Rocko for reminding us! (fixes /stats P bug ;p).
- Added 90% of RC2 release notes.
- Cosmetic doc updates (#0001596) reported by HERZ.
- Updated SSL error for underlying syscall error a bit (#0001615).
- Minor doc updates on SSL (mIRC now supports SSL a bit).
- Fixed yet another fun remote includes memory corruption crash bug due
  to curl strangeness (took me 2 hours to trace down, great!). Reported by Matridom.
- Redesigned the HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_JOIN to support return types of HOOK_DENY,
  HOOK_ALLOW, and HOOK_CONTINUE to prevent a user from joining, to immediately allow
  a user to join, and to proceed on to see if other modules will deny the user.
  Based on a suggestion by satmd (#0001604)
- Imported TRE 0.6.5 on Win32 and Linux, solves (#0001542) and (#0001564) reported 
  by methos
- Added rest of release notes.
- Added first 2 rules to spamfilter.conf, update release notes and unrealinst.iss
  for it too (also added missing badwords.quit.conf file @ win32).
- And some more spamfilter.conf rules (mirseed & fagot).
- Updated /credits with a few more donators (listed in no particular order)
- Fixed a little error in the spamfilter.conf

*** RC2 release ***
- Fixed a bug regarding the new HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_JOIN reported by bla
- Fixed a compile problem on Solaris due to tar not supporting the z option
*** RC2fix release ***
- spamfilter.conf: fixed fyle sig (was bad!), some minor updates to the rest,
  added mirc 6.12 exploit sig. Reported by PHANTOm.
- Added a check to try and prevent people from adding all-encompassing

  correctly work with modes created by modules, the module _must_ call CmodeAdd
  from Mod_Test (#0001624) reported by thunderbirdjl
- Made some changes to the curlinstall script to make it work with c-ares-1.0.0
  also updated INSTALL.REMOTEINC
- Fixed a typo in the /credits
- Made it so curlinstall doesn't use cp -f since it is nonportable
- Hide server IP in /stats z
- First Opteron crash bugfix. Thanks to Liverbugg for helping us trace this issue.
- More Opteron fixes... sizeof() fun, %B fun (always use a 'long'!), etc..
