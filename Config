# Config script for UnrealIRCd
# (C) 2001-2021 The UnrealIRCd Team
#
# This configure script is free software; the UnrealIRCd Team gives 
# unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify as long as the
# copyright headers stay intact
#
#
# Rewritten completely to be an interface to autoconf by codemastr
# This was inspired by the config by Michael Graff (explorer@flame.org)
# but was written from scratch

# In order to be faster than the old Config, this assumes that all information
# in the cache file is valid and therefore doesn't check it, so if you messed with
# default values thats your problem :P

# some bits edited by baafie on March 17 2004, every change marked.
