Welcome to the doxygen-generated documentation for the UnrealIRCd 5.x API.
This is intended **for developers only!**

If you are creating a 3rd party module for UnrealIRCd or are interested
in contributing to UnrealIRCd then this is the right place.

Here you should be able to find a lot of information on the data structures
and functions available to you when coding for UnrealIRCd.

## Wiki documentation ##
* Be sure to check the [Module API](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Dev:Module_API) article on the wiki
  as well, which provides a better *overview* of the module API

## Doxygen docs ##
* [Functions and structs ordered by purpose](modules.html) - **this contains most of the module API!**
* [The most common structs](group__CommonStructs.html) - like Client, User, Server, Channel, etc.
* [All structs](classes.html) - in a simple alphabetical index
* [Browse by source file](dir_68267d1309a1af8e8297ef4c3efbcdba.html) - see all src/*.c files and their (documented) functions.
