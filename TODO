* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ IPv6 ]:
    Add IPv6 compatiblity (requested by many people). Must allow :'s in
    hostnames, will kill backwards compatiblity when IPv6 is enabled

* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ Code ] :
    Split up code, and make the placement of functions more logic

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 4 - [ Zip_Links ]:
    Actually add this since it was planned for 3.0

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 5 - [ Dynconf Recode ]:
    Dynconf has a bunch of bugs that can be resolved with a recode

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 8 - [ +I Fixes ]:
    +I still has some bugs that may cause desync and show users
    that the +I user is actually on the channel.

* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ Bugfixes/Hash ]:
    Check for possible hash bug with del_from_client_table or something
    People still complain about crashes
    We might have fixed this with recent SERVER passwd fix and other passwd
    fixes

[[r00t3d](~lok70@168.213.226.rox-62220)] The other one, is lets say you are on
          server (a), and you set +p to your channel. All the users on Server
          (b,c, etc..) when they do a /list can see the +p channel in the
          list. Now if I set it wih chanserv ie.. mlock +ntp, it doesn't do
          that.. ON all servers (a,b,c) no one sees the +p channel in /list
          unless they are in the channel allready. 
    Solution: Fix send_list to use PubChannel instead of SecretChannel
	(Unable to reproduce. +p channels are hidden on all servers -- codemastr)

[[r00t3d](~lok70@168.213.226.rox-62220)] If you are set +I (Tech
          Admin/Network Admin) and you are set +q/+a in a channel. When someone /whoises
          you hey see the channel names: *#channel ^#channel.
  Fix /whois ShowChannel code

	Challenge/Response kind of thing.
            
	/CHALLENGE nick keyname/commonidentifier type :b64text
	  type = 0, challenge type = 1, response
         Must be flood controlled in some way
         Can only work between servers and or U:lines and or 
           +z users

	Example:
          > :Stskeeps CHALLENGE RaYmAn rayman.pem 0 :0D0FE5F6D46
          < :RaYmAn CHALLENGE Stskeeps rayman.pem 1 :D0F5F543433
        
	The way this works is, that the challenger got RaYmAn's public RSA key
        and he needs to authenticate that he is really talking to RaYmAn (the
        real one). He then sends a random string to RaYmAn, encrypted with 
        RaYmAn's public key. RaYmAn then decrypts it using his private key, and
        then re-encrypts the random stuff using his private key, and sends back
        to Stskeeps, Sts then checks with decrypting the crypted text using the public
        key, and if its OK, then considers him OK. 

        We can use this for NickServ authentication using RSA keys, 
        or server<->server authentication, or /oper authentication
        (no more stolen passwords, yipieeeeeeee)

        This is also easily possible to add, in IRCii, in BitchX, EPIC, 
        mIRC (DLLs), etc.
        
        This is also good for raising security/authenticating to another level.
        Users can check if they are talking to the right person, NickServ databases
        no longer needs to have passwords, just use RSA keys

	connect to a server, /oper, then run telnet and link a server. Close the telnet but do NOT
 	send a SQUIT, the server displays no notice to opers that the server split.
          Stskeeps> +j? but yes, there's a bug there

* stskeeps - Sat Dec 23 2000 - 10 - [ Bugfixes ]
         There's some kind of bug that shows people being on same channel
         twice. I got a feeling its to do with JOIN/SJOIN as its only remote.
