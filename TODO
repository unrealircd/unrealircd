* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ IPv6 ]:
    Add IPv6 compatiblity (requested by many people). Must allow :'s in
    hostnames, will kill backwards compatiblity when IPv6 is enabled

* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ Code ] :
    Split up code, and make the placement of functions more logic

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 4 - [ Zip_Links ]:
    Actually add this since it was planned for 3.0

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 5 - [ Dynconf Recode ]:
    Dynconf has a bunch of bugs that can be resolved with a recode

* codemastr - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 8 - [ +I Fixes ]:
    +I still has some bugs that may cause desync and show users
    that the +I user is actually on the channel.

* stskeeps - Tue Dec 12 2000 - 1 - [ Bugfixes/Hash ]:
    Check for possible hash bug with del_from_client_table or something
    People still complain about crashes

* stskeeps - Wed Dec 13 2000 - 10 - [ Bugfixes ]:
[[r00t3d](~lok70@168.213.226.rox-62220)] The other one, is lets say you are on
          server (a), and you set +p to your channel. All the users on Server
          (b,c, etc..) when they do a /list can see the +p channel in the
          list. Now if I set it wih chanserv ie.. mlock +ntp, it doesn't do
          that.. ON all servers (a,b,c) no one sees the +p channel in /list
          unless they are in the channel allready. 
    Solution: Fix send_list to use PubChannel instead of SecretChannel

* stskeeps - Wed Dec 13 2000 - 10 - [ Bugfixes ]:
[[r00t3d](~lok70@168.213.226.rox-62220)] If you are set +I (Tech
          Admin/Network Admin) and you are set +q/+a in a channel. When someone /whoises
          you hey see the channel names: *#channel ^#channel.
  Fix /whois ShowChannel code
