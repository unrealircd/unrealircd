# UnrealIRCD Crontab v2.1
# $Id$
#
# This is a script suitable for use in a crontab.  It checks to make sure
# your ircd is running.  YOU NEED A SEPARATE CRON JOB FOR EACH IRCD.  If your
# ircd isn't found, it'll try to start it back up.
#
# You'll need to edit this script for your ircd.
#
# To check for your ircd every 10 minutes, put the following line in your
# crontab:
#    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/ircdchk
# And if you don't want to get email from crontab when it checks you ircd,
# put the following in your crontab:
#    0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /home/mydir/ircdchk >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# change this to the mail address to mail output to:
MAIL=me
# change this to the directory you run your ircd from:
dir="../src"

# change this to the name of your ircd's file in that directory:
ircdexe="ircd"

# I wouldn't touch this if I were you.
ircdname="../ircd.pid"

########## you probably don't need to change anything below here ##########

cd $dir
if test -r $ircdname; then
  # there is a pid file -- is it current?
  ircdpid=`cat $ircdname`
  if `kill -CHLD $ircdpid >/dev/null 2>&1`; then
    # it's still going
    # back out quietly
    exit 0
