UnrealIRCd is a free program, but we do put a lot of time, effort, and money
into creating and maintaining Unreal. To make it easier for user's to show their
appreciation, the Unreal team has decided to accept donations through PayPal. If
you like Unreal, and you'd like to see it continue to exist, please consider making
a donation. We're not asking for anything huge, whatever you can afford is fine.

PayPal Donation Link: http://www.unrealircd.com/donate

If you don't want to use PayPal, or you want to donate something other than money,
contact Syzop (syzop@unrealircd.com).

All those who donate at least a certain minimum amount will have their name
and/or company listed in /CREDITS.
Additionally, all donators will be listed on the website (regardless of the amount).
Please check the website for details.

Thank you for your support,
The UnrealIRCd Team
