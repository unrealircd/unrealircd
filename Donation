UnrealIRCd is a free program, but we do put a lot of time, effort, and money
into creating and maintaining Unreal. To make it easier for user's to show their
appreciation, the Unreal team has decided to accept donations through PayPal. If
you like Unreal, and you'd like to see it continue to exist, please consider making
a donation. We're not asking for anything huge, whatever you can afford is fine.

PayPal Donation Link:
<https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=donation%40unrealircd.org&
item_name=UnrealIRCd+Donation&no_shipping=1&cn=Comments&tax=0&currency_code=USD>

Or simply send a payment through PayPal to:
donation@unrealircd.org

If you don't want to use PayPal, or you want to donate something other than money
(old computer hardware, etc.), contact Stskeeps (stskeeps@unrealircd.com) and send
your donation to:

UnrealIRCd Project
C/O Carsten Munk
P.O.Box 52
7400 Herning
Denmark

All those who donate at least $10 USD will have their name and/or company listed in /credits.
Additionally, all donators will be listed on the website (regardless of the amount). To make 
this possible, please include along with your donation the name (or nickname) you want to 
appear in the list as well as the company name (or IRC server) to list. 

Thank you for your support,
The UnrealIRCd Team
